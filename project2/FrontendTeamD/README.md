# Zelda Bazaar

## Project Overview
This project is an e-commerce site where users can purchase items from the Legend of Zelda series. Money can be used to purchase power ups from the item shop. Bought power ups are displayed to users and help increase the amount of money obtained from each click in a minigame. Users are able to create an account, log in to their registered account, browse items, add items to their cart, and purchase items.

## MVP Goals
### As a user:
- I can login
- Register for an account
- Click on Link/Zelda to generate coins
- Buy power ups from the store to increase base amount of coins generated in profile page
- See the list of available products to buy. If already bought, it will be displayed in a “owned power ups” section
- Power ups can be added/deleted from a cart for checkout. The total will be subtracted from user’s income

### Stretch goals:
- Allow for item upgrades
- Allow users to add friends and view their friend’s character
- Make the game functionally Auto coin generating
- Allow users to dress up Link/Zelda
